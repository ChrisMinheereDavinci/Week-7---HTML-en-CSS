                    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my
                    name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting
                    outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what
                    you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for
                    an infant named Jeb.

                <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show
                    that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're
                    going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become
                    nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>

                    while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give
                    you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning
                    over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>
